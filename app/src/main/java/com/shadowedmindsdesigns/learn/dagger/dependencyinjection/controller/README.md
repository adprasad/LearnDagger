Controller Scoped Dagger Configuration
=
Activity and Fragment are like Controllers im MVC. It makes sense to use a single Dagger Component to manage both as they will normally depend on the same set of services.

Controller Scope
-
Defines a "controller level" scope to the application

Controller Component
-
Defines what is going to be provided and what needs to be injected to provide.

Is a sub-component which means it is based on or part of another component. Here, the application is the parent. To establish that relationship the ApplicationComponent interface needs to be updated.

Sub-components automatically get direct access to parents DI graph which makes maintaining DI logic "easier" (according to instructor).

Use stand-alone sub-component in order to inject into Activities and Fragments.

To use this schema you need an inject method for every activity/fragment type because otherwise it will not know what needs injected. I was orignially using the baseactivity as in the component inject method but my example activity needed more injections than what the base class needed causing those required injections to be null.

Controller Module
-

A real class that does the actual provisioning based on scope.

Provides services required by an activity including: context, fragment support manager, a way to make dialogs or snackbar messages...

Its based out of the activity or fragment housing it. So when you build a fragment the activity it references is itself. See code.

Cannot be constructed outside of activity scope as it requires an activity to be bootstrapped.

In Actvity/Fragment Class
-
Controller component is not used to declare global services so no need for a local variable to hold this. The get will create a new version each time (?);

@Inject added for any properties provided by DI (ex. fragmentmanager)
